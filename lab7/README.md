### Lab 7

Initial untuned state after training with 10 Epochs and 512 Hidden neurons per layer

Slightly adjusted number of epochs (from 10 to 20) yielded the following results, decreasing the error.

Continuing this path epochs = 50, hidden neurons per layer = 10000 further decreases the error of the performance.
Needless to say, the error would continue decreasing (though this is admiteddly not the best way of resolving the problem)
